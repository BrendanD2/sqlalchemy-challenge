In this activity we analyzed the station and measurement classes from a hawaii sql database. To accomplish this I created an engine through sqlalchemy to view the data in each class. After organizing this data, I analyzed the most recent date value in the measurement class and recorded the past 12 months of precipitation from that most recent date. I think used pandas to plot this relationship of date and precipitation over a year period through a bar graph. Then, I found the total number of stations from the station class. I then displayed the count of records for each unique station. I then took the most used station and found the temperature over a 12 month period from the most recent date value found earlier. I displayed this information through a histogram. The analysis and findings of this can be found in the climate_starter.ipynb file.

Next, I designed a climate app through flask api. I first created a homepage to display the routes of precipitation, station, tobs, start, and start/end. The precipitation tab finds the records of prcp for the past year from the most recent date in a jsonify dictionary display. The stations tab displays all of the unique stations and their names. The tobs page shows the temperature over the past year of the most active station. the start page finds the min, max, and average of the temperature from any data set that is greater than or equal to the start date that is user given. The start/end tab finds the min, max, and average of the temperature for all of the data between the user given data points. To find this application please see the app.py file and make sure you are in the SurfsUp folder while performing the application.
